# records
Web app to my record collection, wantlist and upcoming records.

The python script iterates all folders and their subfolders in the working directory and saves the folder names to CSV and JSON files. The script assumes that the album's release date is stored in the beginning of the folder name inside parentheses. I have organized my music library with foobar2000.
